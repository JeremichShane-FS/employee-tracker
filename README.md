# Employee Tracker

You can find the deployed project at [Employee Tracker](https://jeremichshane-fs.github.io/employee-tracker/)

## Overview

A small employee tracker program that will utilize inheritance, modular design, and the use of data structures and more advanced array methods.

> **The Challenge**

This requires creating a JavaScript program structured within a Main class and an IIFE for instantiation. It involves implementing inheritance with three classes: Employee (superclass), PartTime, and Manager. Each class has specific properties and a calculatePay() method to determine annual salaries. The program includes a menu-driven interface with options to add, remove, edit, and display employee information. Input prompts facilitate user interaction for adding/editing employees, while console output provides clear presentation of employee data, including ID, name, salary, hours, pay, and employee type. The implementation ensures modularity, clear user feedback, and adherence to object-oriented principles.
